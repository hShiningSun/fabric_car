# List of orderers to send transaction and channel create/update requests to. For the time
# being only one orderer is needed. If more than one is defined, which one get used by the
# SDK is implementation specific. Consult each SDK's documentation for its handling of orderers.

orderers:

  #   # common orderer config items between all the orderers in  config
  #   # these are standard properties defined by the gRPC library

  #   grpcOptions:
  #     # These parameters should be set in coordination with the keepalive policy on the server,
  #     # as incompatible settings can result in closing of connection.
