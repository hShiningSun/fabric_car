    # blockHeightLagThreshold sets the block height lag threshold. This value is used for choosing a peer
    # to connect to. If a peer is lagging behind the most up-to-date peer by more than the given number of
    # blocks then it will be excluded from selection.
    # If set to 0 then only the most up-to-date peers are considered.
    # If set to -1 then all peers (regardless of block height) are considered for selection.
    # Default: 5
    blockHeightLagThreshold: 2

    # reconnectBlockHeightLagThreshold - if >0 then the event client will disconnect from the peer if the peer's
    # block height falls behind the specified number of blocks and will reconnect to a better performing peer.
    # If set to 0 then this feature is disabled.
    # Default: 0 (disabled)
    # NOTES:
    #   - This feature should only be enabled when using deliver events, otherwise events may be lost during reconnect
    #   - Setting this value too low may cause the event client to disconnect/reconnect too frequently, thereby
    #     affecting performance.
